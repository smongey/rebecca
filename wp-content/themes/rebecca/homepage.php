				<p>I love to write.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by language, the colour and rhythms of speech, how we use words to portray our emotions in different settings.</p>
				<p>In my writing I&rsquo;m constantly trying to discover the conscious and the unconscious voice. To explore the forces in peopleâ€™s lives which are at the heart of my story and give voice to them.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to share those stories with audiences in radio, television and theatre.</p>
